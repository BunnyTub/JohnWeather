				<p>Johnthan Weathers III stood in the middle of his town like it was a grand capital. Dev Whartz walked up, looked down the road, and stopped. The road did a weird zigzag, dipped into a puddle, then ended at a single torch like it was a monument.<br><br>
Dev said, So what is this route supposed to be. Johnthan nodded proudly and said, That is Weathers Boulevard. Dev stared at the torch. It goes nowhere. Johnthan replied, It goes somewhere emotionally.<br><br>
Dev tried to be nice. Okay. I respect the vision. But why does it turn seven times in ten blocks. Johnthan said, Traffic calming. Dev said, There is no traffic. Johnthan said, Not with that attitude.<br><br>
Dev pointed at a house made of cobble, birch, and one lonely block of nether wart. Is that design. Johnthan said, It is called character. Dev said, It is called a cry for help. Johnthan said, My builders license is valid.<br><br>
Dev sighed. Look, I am not trying to disrespect you. I just want to connect the town to the main network so people can actually use it. Johnthan said, It already connects. You just have to believe. Dev said, I have to walk through a cactus to believe.<br><br>
Dev offered a compromise. I will keep your original road exactly as it is. I will just build a clean connector next to it. Johnthan paused, narrowed his eyes, and said, So you are adding a side piece road. Dev said, That is not what I said.<br><br>
Dev kept his tone calm. Johnthan, I am being civil. I am literally offering to preserve your work. Johnthan replied, Preserve it like a museum piece while you build the real one next to it. Dev said, Yes. Because it needs a real one.<br><br>
Johnthan smiled, but it was the kind of smile that means disaster is buffering. So we agree. You think my roads are fake. Dev said, I think your roads are experimental. Johnthan said, You spelled horrible wrong.<br><br>
Dev tried to laugh it off. Come on, man. It is not that deep. Johnthan said, Not that deep. You are standing on my legacy of gravel. Dev said, Your legacy of gravel is two blocks wide and ends at a torch.<br><br>
Johnthan got louder. Stop talking about the torch. Dev said, I am sorry, the Torch of Nowhere is a key landmark. Johnthan said, It is a cultural center. Dev said, It is one torch.<br><br>
Dev finally snapped a little. Johnthan, the road literally drives into a pond. Johnthan fired back, It is waterfront property. Dev said, You made it on accident. Johnthan said, You do not know my process.<br><br>
Dev took a breath. Okay. Here is my final offer. I connect the towns. I do not touch your road. Everyone wins. Johnthan leaned forward and said, If you connect those towns, you are connecting disrespect to my front door.<br><br>
Dev said, That makes no sense. Johnthan said, It makes perfect sense. You just do not speak Weathers. Dev said, I speak roads. Johnthan said, No. You speak dictatorship.<br><br>
The chat went quiet. Dev stared. Johnthan stared back. Somewhere nearby, a villager made an hrrm like it was judging both of them. Dev said, Alright. I am done talking. Johnthan said, Good. Because I am done being calm.<br><br>
Johnthan placed one sign on the road, dead center. It read, Do not connect. Dev placed a sign next to it that read, Connecting anyway. Johnthan typed, very slowly, like it was a curse: Dev do not.<br><br>
Dev said, I am doing it. Johnthan said, Then we are done. Dev said, Over roads. Johnthan said, Over principle. Dev said, Over a pond road. Johnthan said, Over waterfront property.<br><br>
A player walked by and said, Yo is this the famous road. Dev said, Yes. Johnthan said, Say it is beautiful. The player said, It is something. Johnthan said, That is disrespect.<br><br>
Dev started placing blocks for a connector. Johnthan watched one block get placed and immediately escalated like a siren. Oh so we are really doing this. Dev said, Yes. Johnthan said, Bet. Dev said, What does that mean.<br><br>
Johnthan jumped on the road, stood on the torch, and declared, This road is protected by the Weathers Doctrine. Dev said, There is no doctrine. Johnthan said, There is now.<br><br>
And that is how a civil conversation about infrastructure turned into a full heated argument, with one torch, one pond, and one man defending the proudest road on the Version 27 Reset like it was sacred ground.
