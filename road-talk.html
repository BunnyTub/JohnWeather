				<p>John Weathers III stood in the middle of his town like it was a grand capital. Dev Whartz walked up, looked down the road, and stopped. The road did a weird zigzag, dipped into a puddle, then ended at a single torch like it was a monument.<br><br>
Dev said, So what is this route supposed to be. John nodded proudly and said, That is Weathers Boulevard. Dev stared at the torch. It goes nowhere. John replied, It goes somewhere emotionally.<br><br>
Dev tried to be nice. Okay. I respect the vision. But why does it turn seven times in ten blocks. John said, Traffic calming. Dev said, There is no traffic. John said, Not with that attitude.<br><br>
Dev pointed at a house made of cobble, birch, and one lonely block of nether wart. Is that design. John said, It is called character. Dev said, It is called a cry for help. John said, My builders license is valid.<br><br>
Dev sighed. Look, I am not trying to disrespect you. I just want to connect the town to the main network so people can actually use it. John said, It already connects. You just have to believe. Dev said, I have to walk through a cactus to believe.<br><br>
Dev offered a compromise. I will keep your original road exactly as it is. I will just build a clean connector next to it. John paused, narrowed his eyes, and said, So you are adding a side piece road. Dev said, That is not what I said.<br><br>
Dev kept his tone calm. John, I am being civil. I am literally offering to preserve your work. John replied, Preserve it like a museum piece while you build the real one next to it. Dev said, Yes. Because it needs a real one.<br><br>
John smiled, but it was the kind of smile that means disaster is buffering. So we agree. You think my roads are fake. Dev said, I think your roads are experimental. John said, You spelled horrible wrong.<br><br>
Dev tried to laugh it off. Come on, man. It is not that deep. John said, Not that deep. You are standing on my legacy of gravel. Dev said, Your legacy of gravel is two blocks wide and ends at a torch.<br><br>
John got louder. Stop talking about the torch. Dev said, I am sorry, the Torch of Nowhere is a key landmark. John said, It is a cultural center. Dev said, It is one torch.<br><br>
Dev finally snapped a little. John, the road literally drives into a pond. John fired back, It is waterfront property. Dev said, You made it on accident. John said, You do not know my process.<br><br>
Dev took a breath. Okay. Here is my final offer. I connect the towns. I do not touch your road. Everyone wins. John leaned forward and said, If you connect those towns, you are connecting disrespect to my front door.<br><br>
Dev said, That makes no sense. John said, It makes perfect sense. You just do not speak Weathers. Dev said, I speak roads. John said, No. You speak dictatorship.<br><br>
The chat went quiet. Dev stared. John stared back. Somewhere nearby, a villager made an hrrm like it was judging both of them. Dev said, Alright. I am done talking. John said, Good. Because I am done being calm.<br><br>
John placed one sign on the road, dead center. It read, Do not connect. Dev placed a sign next to it that read, Connecting anyway. John typed, very slowly, like it was a curse: Dev do not.<br><br>
Dev said, I am doing it. John said, Then we are done. Dev said, Over roads. John said, Over principle. Dev said, Over a pond road. John said, Over waterfront property.<br><br>
A player walked by and said, Yo is this the famous road. Dev said, Yes. John said, Say it is beautiful. The player said, It is something. John said, That is disrespect.<br><br>
Dev started placing blocks for a connector. John watched one block get placed and immediately escalated like a siren. Oh so we are really doing this. Dev said, Yes. John said, Bet. Dev said, What does that mean.<br><br>
John jumped on the road, stood on the torch, and declared, This road is protected by the Weathers Doctrine. Dev said, There is no doctrine. John said, There is now.<br><br>
And that is how a civil conversation about infrastructure turned into a full heated argument, with one torch, one pond, and one man defending the proudest road on the Version 27 Reset like it was sacred ground.</p>
